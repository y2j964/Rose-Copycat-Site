As much as I like doing stylesheets from scratch, I did most of the styling with Bootstrap just as an exercise. I don't think the absence of gutters in the main container looks particularly appealing, but that's what the original looks like, so I replicated it.

The social media icons were made into sprites using Gimp. I made them clickable, because I thought that made sense in this context.
